Breed,About
Aegean cat,"The Aegean cat (Greek: γάτα του Αιγαίου) is a naturally occurring landrace of domestic cat originating from the Cycladic Islands of Greece. Development of the Aegean cat as a formal breed began in the early 1990s by breeders in the fledgling Greek cat fancy, but the variety has yet to be recognized by any major fancier and breeder organization. It is considered to be the only native Greek variety of cat."
American Curl,"The American Curl is a breed of cat characterized by its unusual ears, which curl back from the face toward the center of the back of the skull. An American Curl's ears should be handled carefully because rough handling may damage the cartilage in the ear. The breed originated in Lakewood, California, as the result of a spontaneous mutation.[1]"
American Bobtail,"The American Bobtail is an uncommon breed of domestic cat which was developed in the late 1960s.[1] It is most notable for its stubby ""bobbed"" tail about one-third to one-half the length of a normal cat's tail. This is the result of a cat body type genetic mutation affecting the tail development, similar to that of a Manx cat.[1] The breed is not related to the Japanese Bobtail despite the similar name and physical type—the breeding programs are entirely unrelated, and the genetic mutation causing the bobbed tail are known to be different because the mutation causing the American Bobtail's tail is dominant, whereas the Japanese Bobtail tail mutation is recessive.[2]"
American Shorthair,"The American Shorthair (ASH) is a breed of domestic cat believed to be descended from European cats brought to North America by early settlers to protect valuable cargo from mice and rats.[1] According to the Cat Fancier's Association, in 2012, it was the seventh most popular breed of cat in the United States.[2]"
American Wirehair,"The American Wirehair is a breed of domestic cat originating in upstate New York. As of 2003, though the breed is well-known, it is ranked as the most rare of the 41 Cat Fanciers' Association breeds, with only 22 registered, down from 39 in 2002."
Arabian Mau,"The Arabian Mau is a formal breed of domestic cat, originated from the desert cat, a short-haired landrace native to the desert of the Arabian Peninsula. It lives there in the streets and has adapted very well to the extreme climate. The Arabian Mau is recognized as a formal breed by few fancier and breeder organization and cat registry, World Cat Federation (WCF) and Emirates Feline Federation (EFF). Based on one landrace, the Arabian Mau it is a natural breed."
Australian Mist,The Australian Mist (formerly known as the Spotted Mist) is a breed of cat developed in Australia.
Asian cat,"The Asian, also known as the Malayan, is a cat breed similar to the Burmese but in a range of different coat colours and patterns.[1] Longhaired Asians of all varieties are called Tiffanies. Asians are grouped in the foreign section at cat shows."
Asian Semi-longhair,"The Asian Semi-Longhair is a cat breed similar to the Asian Shorthair except it has semi-long fur. The breed is also known by the name Tiffanie or Tiffany. It is recognized in any of the Asian Shorthair or Burmese colors and patterns. Like the Asian Shorthair, the breed was developed in Britain and is not currently recognized by any U.S. Registries. It has full recognition in the GCCF.[1] It is related to, and in some registries distinct from, the Chantilly-Tiffany or Foreign Longhair, the North American variant."
Balinese cat,"The Balinese is a long-haired breed of domestic cat with Siamese-style point coloration and sapphire-blue eyes. The Balinese is also known as the purebred long-haired Siamese, since it originated as a natural mutation of that breed, and hence is essentially the same cat with a medium-length silky coat and a distinctively plumed tail."
Bambino cat,The Bambino is a breed of cat that was created as a cross between the Sphynx and the Munchkin breeds.
Bengal cat,"The Bengal is a domestic cat breed developed to look like exotic jungle cats such as leopards, ocelots, margays and clouded leopards. Bengal cats were developed by the selective breeding of domestic cats crossed then backcrossed and backcrossed once more with hybrids from the Asian leopard cat (ALC), Prionailurus bengalensis bengalensis, and domestic cat, with the goal of creating a confident, healthy, and friendly cat with a highly contrasted and vividly marked coat.[1]"
Birman,"The Birman, also called the ""Sacred Cat of Burma"",[1] is a domestic cat breed. The Birman is a long-haired, colorpointed cat distinguished by a silky coat, deep blue eyes and contrasting white ""gloves"" or ""socks"" on each paw."

California Spangled,"The California Spangled is a breed of domestic cat that was bred to resemble spotted wild cats, like the ocelot and leopard. They were originally bred in the 1980s and were only ever a rare breed, with only 58 ever being registered.[1] They were usually expensive, priced between US$800 and $2,500.[2] The popularity of two other spotted cats breeds, the Ocicat and the Bengal, overshadowed their development."
Chantilly-Tiffany,"The Chantilly-Tiffany or Chantilly/Tiffany, also known as the Chantilly or the Foreign Longhair, is a breed of cat derived mainly from cross-breeding long-haired Asians and Burmese. The breed originated in North America. This breed is considered distinct from the Asian Semi-longhair breed, the British variant. The Chantilly was thought extinct until the 1960s when two of these cats appeared during an estate sale."
Chartreux,"The Chartreux is a rare breed of domestic cat from France and is recognised by a number of registries around the world. It is not currently recognised by the GCCF in the UK, ostensibly for being too similar to the British Shorthair, one of whose colours is a similar blue-grey. The Chartreux is large and muscular, with relatively short, fine-boned limbs, and very fast reflexes. They are known for their blue (grey) water-resistant short hair double coats which are often slightly nappy in texture (often showing ""breaks"" like a sheepskin) and orange- or copper-colored eyes. Chartreux cats are also known for their ""smile"": due to the structure of their heads and their tapered muzzles, they often appear to be smiling.

Chausie,"The Chausie /ˈtʃaʊsi/ is a domestic breed of cat that was developed by breeding a few individuals from the nondomestic species jungle cat (Felis chaus) to a far greater number of domestic cats (Felis catus). The Chausie was first recognized as a domestic breed by The International Cat Association (TICA). Within the domestic breeds, the Chausie is categorized as a nondomestic hybrid source breed.[1] Other domestic breeds in this category include the Bengal and the Savannah. Because Chausies are mostly descended from domestic cats, by about the fourth generation they are fully fertile and completely domestic in temperament. Chausies should be tall, long, and lean, with very long legs and medium boning. The torso is deep-chested with flat sides. The ears are broad, tall, and set high on the head, about two fingers apart. The cheekbones are striking—prominent, long, and angular—and the eyes are flattened on top and form a half oval below. The coat is short, and the cats can come in three colors: solid black, black grizzled tabby, and black (brown) ticked tabby. Gold or yellow eye color is preferred, though yellower and lighter shades of green are allowed."
Cheetoh cat,"The Bengal is a domestic cat breed developed to look like exotic jungle cats such as leopards, ocelots, margays and clouded leopards. Bengal cats were developed by the selective breeding of domestic cats crossed then backcrossed and backcrossed once more with hybrids from the Asian leopard cat (ALC), Prionailurus bengalensis bengalensis, and domestic cat, with the goal of creating a confident, healthy, and friendly cat with a highly contrasted and vividly marked coat.[1]"
Colorpoint Shorthair,"Colorpoint Shorthairs are a variety of domestic cat. Depending on the cat registry, they may be considered a separate breed of cat, or more often a variant of a pre-existing one, if accepted at all. These cats are distinguished by their conformance to wide range of sixteen different point colors, beyond the four standard Siamese colors. The variety was initially created by crossbreeding Siamese with the American Shorthair – the same mixture that created the Oriental Shorthair, but with different goals. The Colorpoint Shorthair shares the point-coloration pattern with the Siamese, but in the nontraditional colors of red, cream, tortoiseshell, and lynx (tabby) points, and minor variations thereof. In body style, head shape, and other features, it may be intermediate between the two foundation breeds, which show cats leaning toward Siamese traits. Those who favour the Traditional Siamese look may also favour the more moderate-typed Colourpoint Shorthairs that take after their American Shorthair ancestors in shape."
Cornish Rex,"A Cornish Rex is a breed of domestic cat. The Cornish Rex has no hair except for down. Most breeds of cat have three different types of hair in their coats: the outer fur or ""guard hairs"", which is about 5 cm long in shorthairs and 10 cm+ long in longhairs; a middle layer called the ""awn hair""; and the down hair or undercoat, which is very fine and about 1 cm long. Cornish Rexes only have the undercoat. The curl in Cornish Rex fur is caused by a different mutation and gene than that of the Devon Rex. It originates from Cornwall, Britain."
Cymric cat,"The Cymric (/ˈkɪmrᵻk/ kim-rik or /ˈkʌmrᵻk/ kum-rik) is a breed of domestic cat. Some cat registries consider the Cymric simply a semi-long-haired variety of the Manx breed, rather than a separate breed. Except for the length of fur, in all other respects the two varieties are the same, and kittens of either sort may appear in the same litter. The name comes from Cymru (Welsh pronunciation: [ˈkəmrɨ]), the indigenous Welsh name of Wales, though the breed is not associated with Wales, and the name was possibly given as an attempt to provide a ""Celtic""-sounding name for the breed. The breed's Manx bloodline originated in the Isle of Man, though Canada claims to have developed the long-haired variant. The breed is called the Longhair Manx or a similar name by some registries."
Cyprus cat,The Cyprus cat is a landrace of domestic cat believed to be descended from cats of Egypt or Palestine brought to Cyprus by St. Helen to rid the island of snakes and vermin. It is not recognized as a formal breed by any major cat fancier and breeder organization.

Minskin,"The Minskin is a breed of cat derived from crossing the Munchkin with the Sphynx. In 1998 Paul McSorley began the development of the Minskin in Boston, Massachusetts. Just as the Siamese has color restricted to the points/extremities, Paul McSorley envisioned a cat with short legs and fur restricted to the points (fur-points). To accomplish his goal, he crossed his already established Munchkin cats with short legs and fur, with 'fuzzy' Sphynx for the hairless characteristic where fur can occur on the extremities, making for a healthier immune system. He also used his International Award Winning Burmese cats and Devon Rex in the development of his Minskin breeding program. The first cat that met his goal was ""TRT I Am Minskin Hear Me Roar"" 'Rory' was born in July, 2000. By early 2005 about 50 cats meeting the Minskin vision existed and were registered by The International Cat Association.

Much controversy erupted over the breed when it was recognized by The International Cat Association in 1995 with critics voicing concern over potential health and mobility issues."
Nebelung,"The Nebelung is a rare breed of domestic cat. Nebelungs have long bodies, wide-set green eyes, long and dense fur, and mild dispositions. The name Nebelung — apparently a portmanteau of the German word Nebel ('mist' of 'fog'), and the name of a medieval Germanic saga, Nibelungenlied — is perhaps derived from the cat's distinctive silky blue-grey coat and from the breed's progenitors, who were named after the two major figures in the Nibelungenlied, the German warrior Siegfried and the Icelandic queen Brunhilde."
Napoleon cat,"The Minuet cat[1] (also known as the Napoleon) is a new breed, categorized by The International Cat Association (TICA) as a domestic hybrid breed, ""a breed developed from a deliberate cross between two existing domestic breeds, incorporating characteristics of both parental breeds into the new breed."" [2] The two breeds from which make this cat are the Munchkin and the Persian. According to TICA’s official standard for the Minuet, these breeds represent the only permissible outcrosses one may utilize to create the Minuet.[3] This includes the combinations Minuet × Minuet, Minuet× Munchkin, and Minuet× a member of the Persian breeds (including Persians, Himalayans and Exotic Shorthairs. Minuets come in both long-haired and short-haired varieties."
Norwegian Forest cat,"The Norwegian Forest cat (Norwegian: Norsk skogkatt or Norsk skaukatt) is a breed of domestic cat originating in Northern Europe. This natural breed is adapted to a very cold climate, with top coat of glossy, long, water-shedding hairs, and a woolly undercoat for insulation. Although this is uncertain, the breed's ancestors may have been a landrace of short-haired cats brought to Norway by the Vikings around 1000 AD, who may also have brought with them long-haired cats, like those ancestral to the modern Siberian and Turkish Angora breeds. During World War II, the breed became nearly extinct until efforts by the Norwegian Forest Cat Club helped the breed by creating an official breeding program. It was registered as a breed with the European Fédération Internationale Féline in the 1970s, when a local cat fancier, Carl-Fredrik Nordane, took notice of the breed and made efforts to register it. Currently, the Norwegian Forest breed is very popular in Norway, Sweden, Iceland and France."
Ocicat,"The Ocicat is an all-domestic breed of cat which resembles a wild cat but has no wild DNA in its gene pool. The breed is unusual in that it is spotted like a wild cat but has the temperament of a domestic animal. It is named for its resemblance to the ocelot.

Persian cat,"The Persian cat is a long-haired breed of cat characterized by its round face and short muzzle. In Britain, it is sometimes called the Longhair or Persian Longhair. It is also known as the Shiraz or Shirazi, particularly in the Middle East. The first documented ancestors of the Persian were imported into Europe from Persia around 1620.[1] Recognized by the cat fancy since the late 19th century, it was developed first by the English, and then mainly by American breeders after the Second World War. Some cat fancier organizations' breed standards subsume the Himalayan and Exotic Shorthair as variants of this breed, while others treat them as separate breeds."
Traditional Persian,"In modern and recent history in Iran the original and most sought-after ""Persian Cat"" is described as; an all white fur female with different eye colors, often one genetically stripped of pigment (blue) and the other any range of darker color (brown), shades naturally varying from animal to animal.

Ragdoll,"The Ragdoll is a cat breed with blue eyes and a distinct colorpoint coat. It is a large and muscular semi-longhair cat with a soft and silky coat.[1] Developed by American breeder Ann Baker,[2] it is best known for its docile and placid temperament and affectionate nature. The name ""Ragdoll"" is derived from the tendency of individuals from the original breeding stock to go limp and relaxed when picked up.[3] Particularly popular in both the United Kingdom and the breed's native United States, ragdoll cats often are known as ""dog-like cats"" or ""puppy-like cats"" due to behaviors such as their tendency to follow people around, their ease at being physically handled, and their relative lack of aggression toward other pets. [4]"
Russian Blue,"The Russian Blue is a cat breed that comes in colors varying from a light shimmering silver to a darker, slate grey. They develop close bonds with their human companions and are sought out as pets due to their personalities, beauty and coat. It is their short, dense coat which has been the hallmark of the Russian breed for more than a century. The dense coat stands out from the body and you can draw patterns in the coat that will stay until you smooth them out again."
"Russian White, Black and Tabby","The Russian White, Russian Black, and Russian Tabby are breeds of cat created in 1971, derived from the Russian Blue. The Black and Tabby Russians came from the original mating which created the Russian White. It is appropriate to consider their origins first."
Sam Sawet,"The Sam Sawet (Thai: แซมเศวต) is a natural breed of cat that originated in Thailand. This breed has not yet been recognized by any major cat registries. It is a new discovery with undetermined breed standards. It is known to be a medium-sized cat, usually between 9 to 13 pounds.[1]"
Savannah cat,The Savannah is a hybrid cat breed. It is a cross between a serval and a domestic cat.

Selkirk Rex,The Selkirk Rex is a breed of cat with highly curled hair.
Serengeti cat,"The Serengeti is a breed of domestic cat, first developed by crossing a Bengal (domestic and wild hybrid) and an Oriental Shorthair. Recognized and registered by The International Cat Association (TICA), no other first generation crosses can be registered as Serengeti. From the Bengal × Oriental cross came the first foundation Serengeti. Breeders then worked with the cat to produce a cat that resembles the breed profile set by TICA. Created by Karen Sausman of Kingsmark Cattery in California in 1994, the breed is still in the development stages, but the ultimate aim is to produce a cat that looks similar to a serval, without using any recent wild cat blood.[1] (Bengal cats originate from hybridization of leopard cats and domestic cats. Most Bengal cats used in Serengeti breeding programs are many generations removed from these origins and possess few genetic contributions of the wild forbear except alleles affecting coat color.) Serengetis are spotted cats, with long legs and very large, round tipped ears.[2] They have a long neck which blends with the base of the skull without tapering.[3] Males are generally slightly larger and heavier than females and can weigh between 10 to 15 lbs; females generally weigh between 8 and 12 lbs.[4] Because the Bengal stock is a hybrid cat, the Serengeti is also classified as a hybrid."

Derived from the rtgs: wichianmat (Thai: วิเชียรมาศ, [wí.tɕʰīan.mâːt] ( listen)) landrace, one of several varieties of cat native to Thailand (formerly known as Siam), the Siamese became one of the most popular breeds in Europe and North America in the 20th century. The carefully refined modern Siamese is characterized by blue almond-shaped eyes, a triangular head shape, large ears, an elongated, slender, and muscular body, and point colouration. (Aside from the colouration, it bears little resemblance to the original stock, and the more moderate, traditional or ""old-style"" Siamese, with a much rounder head and body, has been re-established by multiple registries as the Thai cat.) The International Cat Association describes the modern Siamese as social, intelligent, and playful into adulthood, often enjoying a game of fetch.[1] Siamese tend to seek human interaction and also like companionship from other cats."
Siberian cat,"The Siberian is a landrace variety of domestic cat, present in Russia for centuries,[3] and more recently developed as a formal breed, with standards promulgated since the late 1980s.[4]"
Singapura cat,"The Singapura is one of the smallest breeds of cats, noted for its large eyes and ears, brown ticked coat and blunt tail. Reportedly established from three ""drain cats"" imported from Singapore in the 1970s, it was later revealed that the cats were originally sent to Singapore from the US before they were exported back to the US. Investigations by the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) concluded no wrongdoing and the Singapura kept its status as a natural breed."
Snowshoe cat,"The Snowshoe is a rare breed of cat originating in the United States of America in the 1960s. Snowshoes were first produced in Philadelphia when a Siamese breeder's cat gave birth to three kittens with white feet. The breeder, Dorothy Hinds-Daugherty, then began a breeding program to produce what were originally called ""Silver Laces"",[1] crossing the strangely marked Siamese cats with bi-color American Shorthair cats and other breeds. When Hinds-Daugherty left the program, Vikki Olander began working with the cats and recruited new breeders, as well as worked towards full recognition within cat associations. Despite having existed for 45 years, Snowshoes are rare due to the difficulty of reproducing the correct coat markings. The marks are based on recessive genes for color points and on the co-dominant but variably-expressed piebald pattern gene, making it difficult to predict the appearance of offspring."
Sokoke,"The Sokoke (or Sokoke Forest Cat in long form, and formerly the African Shorthair) is natural breed of domestic cat, developed and standardised, beginning in the late 1970s, from the feral khadzonzo landrace of eastern, coastal Kenya. The Sokoke is recognized by four major cat pedigree registry organizations as a standardised cat breed.[1][verification needed] It is named after the Arabuko Sokoke National Forest, the environment of from which the foundation stock was obtained, for breed development primarily in Denmark and the United States. The cat is long-legged, with short, coarse hair, and typically a tabby coat, though specific lineages have produced different appearances. Although one rumored to be a domestic × wildcat hybrid, genetic study has not borne out this belief. Another idea, that the variety is unusually ancient, remains unproven either way. The native population is closely related to an island-dwelling group, the Lamu cat, further north."
Somali cat,"The Somali cat is often described as a long-haired Abyssinian. The first Somali cats appeared in the litters of Abyssinians as long-haired kittens. The Somali is a product of a recessive gene in Abyssinian cats, though how the gene was introduced into the Abyssinian gene pool is still a mystery."
Sphynx cat,"The Sphynx is a breed of cat developed through selective breeding starting in the 1960s, known for its lack of a coat (fur), though it is not truly hairless. The skin should have the texture of chamois, as it has fine hairs. Whiskers may be present, either whole or broken, or may be totally absent. The skin is the color their fur would be, and all the usual cat marking patterns (solid, point, van, tabby, tortie, etc.) may be found on Sphynx skin. Because they have no coat, they lose more body heat than coated cats. This makes them warm to the touch as well as heat-seeking."
Suphalak,"The Suphalak (Thai: แมวศุภลักษณ์, แมวทองแดง, rtgs: Suphalak, Thong Daeng) is a solid reddish-brown copper colored, short-haired breed of cat originating in Thailand. The Suphalak is a natural breed and should not be confused with the sable Burmese cat, an established American and European created breed which expresses the colorpoint Burmese gene (cb) that results in a dark points on the extremities such as the ears, feet and tail as well as a dark mask on the face.[1] A written description and pictorial of the Suphalak first appeared in the ancient Thai manuscripts (written by Buddhist monks) over 300 years ago known as the Tamra Maew."
Thai cat,"The Thai cat (Thai: วิเชียรมาศ, [wí.tɕʰīan.mâːt] ( listen), rtgs: wichianmat, meaning 'moon diamond') is a newly renamed but old cat breed, related to but distinct from the Western, modern Siamese cat. This natural breed is descended from the landrace of wichianmat cats of Thailand, and as a standardised breed has also been variously called the Old-style, Old-type, Traditional, or Classic Siamese; the Whichian Mat (anglicised from the Thai name); and the Applehead, a nickname that originated as a pejorative used by breeders of the modern-style Siamese. According to The International Cat Association: ""The Thai is the breed dedicated to preserving the native pointed cat of Thailand in as close to its original form as possible.""[1]"
Tonkinese cat,"Tonkinese are a domestic cat breed produced by crossbreeding between the Siamese and Burmese. They share many of their parents' distinctively lively, playful personality traits and are similarly distinguished by a pointed coat pattern in a variety of colors. In addition to the modified coat colors of the ""mink"" pattern, which is a dilution of the point color (as in watercolors), the breed is now being shown in the foundation-like Siamese and Burmese colors: pointed with white and Solid overall (sepia.) They are also now designated a natural breed, as their history has now determined them to have been extant since the 14th Century[citation needed]."
Toyger,"The toyger is a breed of domestic cat, the result of breeding domestic shorthaired tabbies (beginning in the 1980s) to make them resemble a ""toy tiger"", as its striped coat is reminiscent of the tiger's. The breed's creator, Judy Sugden, has stated that the breed was developed in order to inspire people to care about the conservation of tigers in the wild. It was recognized for ""Registration only"" by The International Cat Association in the early 1990s, and advanced through all requirements to be accepted as a full Championship breed in 2007.[1][2] There are about 20 breeders in the United States and another 15 or so in the rest of the world.[2]"
Turkish Angora,"The Turkish Angora (Turkish: Ankara kedisi, Ankara cat[citation needed]) is a breed of domestic cat. Turkish Angoras are one of the ancient, natural breeds of cat, having originated in central Turkey, in the Ankara region. The breed has been documented as early as the 17th century and is believed to be the origin of the mutations for both the coloration white[citation needed] and long hair[citation needed]. The breed is also sometimes referred to as simply the Angora or Ankara cat[citation needed]."
Turkish Van,"The Turkish Van is a semi-long-haired breed of domestic cat, which was developed in the United Kingdom from a selection of cats obtained from various cities of modern Turkey, especially Southeast Turkey.[1]:112 The breed is rare,[2] and is distinguished by the Van pattern (named for the breed), where the colour is restricted to the head and the tail, and the rest of the cat is white;[2] this is due to the expression of the piebald white spotting gene, a type of partial leucism.[3]:148 A Turkish Van may have blue or amber eyes, or be odd-eyed (having one eye of each colour). The breed has been claimed to be descended from the landrace of usually all-white Van cats (Turkish: Van kedisi), mostly found near Lake Van,[2] though one of the two original breeders' own writings indicate clearly that none of the breed's foundation cats came from the Van area.[1]:114[4]"
Ukrainian Levkoy,"The Ukrainian Levkoy (Ukrainian: Український левкой) is a cat breed of distinct appearance, having inward-folding ears and little to no hair. These cats are of medium size with a longish body, appearing both muscular and slender. They have soft, elastic skin; an excess of which leads to a wrinkled appearance. The breed is not recognized by any major, international cat fancier and breeder organizations, only Ukrainian and Russian clubs."
